# ruby-CLI-edamam

Fitbud is a full backend Ruby Command Line application that allows users to find 
recipes based on their dietary preferences, allergies, and BMR. The application 
calculates a user's BMR based on their information, prompts users to input their 
dietary preferences/allergies, and returns many meal recipes for the user.

This CLI project is a pair programming collaboration with kainan54.
